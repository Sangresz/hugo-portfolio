This is a project that I have done to learn svelte (Javascript framework)

I did it following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydR_M0fw9Xc) tutorial. Customizing most of the website on my own

I added some features like the ability to look for the upcoming film releases.

This app is now hosted on [netlify.com](https://corrado-moviedb.netlify.com/)

Here is the source code on [github.com](https://github.com/Sangresz/MovieDB-svelte)
