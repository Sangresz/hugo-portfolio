This is a project that I have done to strengthen my skills using python with flask. 

I did it following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam0GPOAvVI) tutorial. 

I added some features like the ability to edit the notes, and an options page where you can change your password or email.

This app is now hosted on [heroku.com](https://corrado-noteapp.herokuapp.com/)

Here is the source code on [github.com](https://github.com/Sangresz/Flask-NoteApp)
