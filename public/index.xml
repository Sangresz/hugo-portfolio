      <description>Android application that makes two separate requests to an open data regularly updated daily (around 6:00 pm) the number of COVID-19 contagions.
REQUEST 1: Number of contagions in a certain province from pandemic start until today.
REQUEST 2: Number of contagions from the beginning of the pandemic to today&amp;rsquo;s day from all Italian provinces.
The data is saved to a file in the system so that we avoid redoing the request to the github repository used: https://github.</description>

      <description>This is a project that I have done to strengthen my skills using python with flask.
I did it following this tutorial.
I added some features like the ability to edit the notes, and an options page where you can change your password or email.
This app is now hosted on heroku.com
Here is the source code on github.com</description>
